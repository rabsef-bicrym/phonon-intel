"""Rolling live-transcription session for the CUDA runtime.

A port of the Mac engine's `fermion._speech.live.LiveSession` — the same
constants, the same energy-gated segmentation, the same partial cadence —
with the decode call swapped for the container's gated dense Torch path.
The session logic is deliberately kept line-for-line comparable with the Mac
module so the two backends segment identically.

ONE SESSION, TWO FEEDS: the long-file transcription path and the WebSocket
streaming endpoint both push audio through `feed_pcm()`, which re-blocks
arbitrary-sized input into fixed 50 ms blocks before segmentation. Identical
audio therefore produces the identical block sequence — and, with the
deterministic gated decode, identical finals — regardless of how the bytes
arrived. That is what makes the streaming `done` transcript equal the file
transcript byte for byte.

Partial decodes never mutate the segment buffer, so a session with partials
disabled (the file path) finalizes exactly the same segments as one with
partials enabled (the streaming path).
